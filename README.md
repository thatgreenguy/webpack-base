# webpack-base

Webpack 4 base setup - use as a starting point to build your next web project

This provides a good starting point for any webpack 4 based project.

Configuration provides a good starting point with everything required to get up and running quickly. 
Configuration is nicely divided between dev and production with both configs sharing a common base - see the build directory.

`npm run dev`

Runs webpack dev server locally without any css or js optimisations.

`npm run build`

Clears the dist directory and rebuilds with the css and js optimisations.
